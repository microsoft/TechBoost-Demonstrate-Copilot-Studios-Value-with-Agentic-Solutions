## Introduction
Contoso wants to validate that a conversational agent can capture booking requests 24/7, reduce call volume, and integrate with existing data. This exercise lets the team experience and dissect such an agent.

## Objectives
After you complete this exercise, you'll be able to:
- Demonstrate how a Copilot agent guides customers through booking.
- Test agent behaviour and trace topic transitions.
- Map agent logic to underlying Dataverse tables.

**Duration**: 15 min
