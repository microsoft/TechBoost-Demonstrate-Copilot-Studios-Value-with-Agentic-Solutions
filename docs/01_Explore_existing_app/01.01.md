#### Initial project specification

Contoso Real Estate sells and manages both commercial and residential real estate properties. Customer information is stored in their current Dataverse instance.

Bookings previously could only be requested over the phone, causing the Contoso phone line to always be busy. Despite their importance, many customers couldn't get through to the office to request their services. Long wait times could mean customers get frustrated and hang up. This frustration can result in loss of business for Contoso.

The seller is in a discovery call. They they want to qualify the opportunity and envision with the Real Estate company. They pitch them on an AI app where customers discover information about the real estate booking process and creates booking requests for the office to review.

A well-built agent provides customers with the ability to submit their booking request information in their own time, reducing the time waiting on the phone. Happy customers are likely to share their experience with others and increase business for Contoso Real Estate.

- Contoso Real Estate would like the Bookings to be done in a Mobile App or from a website so that customers and Real Estate sales reps can do data entry

- The database and the Apps will be supplied by a Consultant who gives you the files to install them. They will also provide some sample data for you to train new employees

- You will also be given the database stored in the Dataverse (a special database for Low Code Apps). You can use these as a starting point for the Custom Copilot

#### Business Needs

1. Digital Booking: Contoso wants to offer customers a way to book services online, either through a mobile app or a website. This would allow customers to book without needing to call and would make it easier for sales reps to follow up and manage these requests.

2. Self-Service for Customers: Customers should be able to learn about the booking process and submit booking requests on their own, without waiting on the phone. This would make the process faster and more convenient for everyone.

3. Ease of Data Entry: Contoso wants both customers and sales reps to easily enter and manage booking details. The goal is to reduce mistakes and make the entire process faster.

4. Integration with Current System: The new system should work well with the Dataverse system where Contoso's customer data is stored, so they don't need to start from nothing.

2. Disruption to Business: Contoso is worried about how a new system might disrupt their current processes. They don't want to make changes that will cause confusion or slow things down for their team.

3. Customer Resistance: Some customers may not be comfortable using new technology, especially if they're used to booking by phone. Contoso needs a solution that will be easy for everyone to use, even for less tech-savvy customers.

5. Integration with Current Tools: Contoso already uses Dataverse to store customer information. Any new solution needs to work smoothly with this system without causing extra work for their team.
