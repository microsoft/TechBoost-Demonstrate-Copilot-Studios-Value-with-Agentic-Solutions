## Task 02: Examine the present state of the app

## Introduction
Contoso Real Estate has already invested in Microsoft platforms including **M365** and **Power Platform** to rapidly build their app. Their solution includes these components:

-   Model-driven app that can create records for properties and bookings
-   Manual data entry and phone or personal interactions, with much transcription

Contoso reviews its existing Dataverse app to spot manual steps that slow sales reps.

## Description
You will open the Bookings solution, run the model driven app, and create two sample property records.

## Success criteria
•	The Bookings solution opens and the model driven app launches successfully.
•	Two properties (North Offices and South Condo) are saved and visible in the Properties view.
•	You can navigate app tables and confirm data is stored in Dataverse.
